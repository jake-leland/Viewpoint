Visualizes a camera's field of view.

*Note: This is a [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch.*

This sketch is intended to visualize a camera's field of view.

Controls:
- MOUSE = camera location
- UP/DOWN = camera rotation
- LEFT/RIGHT = camera field of view
- CLICK = place an object
- SPACE = change field color

This project was developed to visualize the field of view of the Xbox Kinect, but this sketch has been modified to work without a Kinect.
