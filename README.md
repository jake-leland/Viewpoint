Visualizes a camera's field of view.

*Note: This is a [Processing](http://processing.org) sketch.*

This sketch is intended to visualize a camera's field of view.
The camera is located at the mouse location.

Controls:
- UP/DOWN = camera rotation
- LEFT/RIGHT = camera field of view
- CLICK = place a object
- SPACE = change the color of the camera field of view

This project was developed to visualize the field of view of the Xbox Kinect, but this sketch has been modified to work without a Kinect.
